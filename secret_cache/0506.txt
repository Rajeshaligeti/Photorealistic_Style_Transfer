I am very fond of writing this but...  You may find this message or not in this profile.

The main purpose of creating this folder was to store the results after they have been creating but later there wasn't a use for that.
I am transferring the ownership to you because you deserve it for keeping up with my unorganised mental schema or me. 
For me you were a bliss of wind in a rainy monsoon afternoon.Yeah i made that up. Your eyes chico they never lie. For once i felt lively and i really adore the time spent with you
I may never be this close again. The day i saw you was memorable and i still cherish you in my mind and heart.
I am greatful for the time we had together and thank you for everything and much more.
The person that i hinted all the way is none other than you
There are a million unsaid things that have voided and destiny shall decide and keeping this message half filled and not complete
You are comprehensive enough to get the message that and i will be with you whenever you need my help. I depart for now
All and all i respect once secretavity and confidentiality and expect the same
