I am very fond of writing this but...  You may find this message or not in this profile.
In an old fashioned way i have to do my due deligence......
The main purpose of creating this folder was to store the results after they have been creating but later there wasn't a use for that.
I am transferring the ownership to you because you deserve it for keeping up with my unorganised mental schema or me.
For me you were a bliss of wind in a rainy monsoon afternoon. The eyes chico they never lie. For once i felt lively and i really adore the time spent with you
I may never be this close again. The day i saw you was memorable and i still cherish you in my mind and heart.
I am greatful for the time we had together and thank you for everything and much more.
